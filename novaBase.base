Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens.	fear
Most of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.	fear
Facing your fears � even with the odds in your favor � doesn�t guarantee success. However, refusing to face them ensures you haven�t fully explored what it means to live a meaningful life.	fear

All your idols live with that fear just as much as you do. We are all in this together. We all get nervous.	fear

Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we often might win, by fearing to attempt.	fear
The moment we begin to fear the opinions of others and hesitate to tell the truth that is in us, and from motives of policy are silent when we should speak, the divine floods of light and life no longer flow into our souls.	fear
You are born with only two fears: fear of falling and fear of loud noise. All the rest is learned. And it�s a lot of work!	fear

People living deeply have no fear of death.	fear
I cannot escape death, but at least I can escape the fear of it.	fear
Death and pain are not frightening, it�s the fear of pain and death we need to fear.	fear
Wherever you are afraid, try to explore, and you will find death hiding somewhere behind. All fear is of death. Death is the only fear source.	fear
Why should I fear death? If I am, then death is not. If Death is, then I am not. Why should I fear that which can only exist when I do not?	fear
I�m not afraid of death anymore. And I think a lot of the struggle that we have in life comes from a deep, deep fear of death. And it can take form in many ways. One can be that we want to write the great American novel, or we really want to achieve something in this world, we want to build something, we want to build a great piece of technology or we want to start an amazing business or we want to run for office and make a difference.	fear
All fears are children of the fear of death.	fear
It�s not that we fear death, it�s that we fear not living the life we want.	fear
All men fear death. It�s a natural fear that consumes us all. We fear death because we feel that we haven�t loved well enough or loved at all, which ultimately are one and the same.	fear
To fear death, gentlemen, is no other than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know. No one knows whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for a man, yet men fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils.	fear
People fear death even more than pain. It�s strange that they fear death. Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over.	fear
I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I believe there is nothing on the other side of death to fear. I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think of death as the same state.	fear
He is terribly afraid of dying because he hasn�t yet lived.	fear
Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.	fear
Whatever scares or discomforts you is your teacher.	fear
Every time we choose safety, we reinforce fear.	fear
Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.	fear
The happiness of childhood, the calming of a child�s fears and the healthy development of its self-confidence depend directly upon love.	fear
Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity. They seem to be more afraid of life than death.	fear
Freethinkers are those who are willing to use their minds without prejudice and without fearing to understand things that clash with their own customs, privileges, or beliefs.	fear
I think the big mistake in schools is trying to teach children anything, and by using fear as the basic motivation. Fear of getting failing grades, fear of not staying with your class, etc. Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.	fear
It�s the questions we can�t answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he�ll look for his own answers.	fear
Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.	fear
We need to get rid of the fear and guilt we might have for asserting ourselves. It serves no purpose except to keep us down.	fear
Man is a procrastinator by nature. He procrastinates because he fears discomfort.	fear
We�d rather live with our problems than adapt to the solutions.	fear
We�re predisposed to hate variation because it causes change. Change creates uncertainty. And uncertainty causes anxiety and insecurity.	fear
Don�t fear change. You may lose something good, but you may also gain something great.	fear
And loss of control is always the source of fear. It is also, however, always the source of change.	fear
One can choose to go back toward safety or forward toward growth. Growth must be chosen again and again; fear must be overcome again and again.	fear
I don�t let go of my thoughts, I meet them with understanding, then they let go of me.	fear
It is not change that causes anxiety; it is the feeling that we are without defenses in the presence of what we see as danger that causes anxiety.	fear
When we speak we are afraid our words will not be heard nor welcomed but when we are silent we are still afraid. So it is better to speak remembering we were never meant to survive.	fear
I have accepted fear as part of life � specifically the fear of change� I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says: turn back.	fear
I wonder if fears ever really go away, or if they just lose their power over us.	fear
I can�t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I�m frightened of the old ones.	fear
We grow fearless when we do the things we fear.	fear
No longer be either dissatisfied with thy present lot, or shrink from the future.	fear
There is no fear for one whose mind is not filled with desires.	fear
A quiet mind is able to hear intuition over fear.	fear
To fully accept suffering and misfortune frees you from fear.	fear
Abundance comes from a place of confidence. Scarcity comes from a place of fear.	fear
Don�t dwell on the past or fear for the future; simply live the present moment wisely.	fear
A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.	fear
Life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future.	fear
Fear? What has a man to do with fear? Chance rules our lives, and the future is all unknown. Best live as we may, from day to day.	fear
Anger and fear undermine our immune system, while warm-heartedness brings peace of mind. Therefore, just as we teach children to comply with physical hygiene for the good of their health, we should also counsel them in a kind of hygiene of the emotions.	fear
The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated. And the only thing people regret is that they didn�t live boldly enough, that they didn�t invest enough heart, didn�t love enough. Nothing else really counts at all.	fear
Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact.	fear
Concern for others� well being reduces fear and suspicion, prompting the openness and transparency that gives rise to trust and friendship.	fear
Freedom is the basis of all happiness. This means freedom from despair, freedom from resentment, freedom from jealousy and fear. Genuine practice is practice that helps you become more free and more solid. Every step you take, every breath you take, every minute of sitting.	fear
We fear that this moment will end, that we won�t get what we need, that we will lose what we love, or that we will not be safe.	fear
What the world needs most is more love, more generosity, more mercy, more openness. The root of human problems is not a lack of resources but comes from the misunderstanding, fear, and separateness that can be found in the hearts of people.	fear
True happiness is to enjoy the present without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied, for he that is wants nothing.	fear
All this hurrying from place to place won�t bring you any relief, for you�re travelling in the company of your own emotions, followed by your troubles all the way.	fear
Wild animals run from the dangers they actually see, and once they have escaped them worry no more. We however are tormented alike by what is past and what is to come. A number of our blessings do us harm, for memory brings back the agony of fear while foresight brings it on prematurely. No one confines his unhappiness to the present.	fear
Caretake this moment. Immerse yourself in its particulars. Respond to this person or that person, this challenge, this deed. Quit the evasions. Stop giving yourself needless trouble. It is time to really live; to fully inhabit the situation you happen to be in right now. You are not some disinterested bystander. Participate. Exert yourself.	fear
People will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls.	fear
The key to success is for you to make a habit throughout your life of doing the things you fear.	fear
If you go deeper and deeper into your own heart, you�ll be living in a world with less fear, isolation and loneliness.	fear
The emotion of fear often works overtime. Even when there is no immediate threat, our body may remain tight and on guard, our mind narrowed to focus on what might go wrong. When this happens, fear is no longer functioning to secure our survival. We are caught in the trance of fear and our moment-to-moment experience becomes bound in reactivity. We spend our time and energy defending our life rather than living it fully.	fear
Accept who you are; and revel in it.	fear
There�s no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it.	fear
There is fear and insecurity in pride, for when one aims at being highly esteemed, and having achieved such status, he is automatically involved in the fear of losing one�s status.	fear
There is no beauty in sadness. No honor in suffering. No growth in fear. No relief in hate. It�s just a waste of perfectly good happiness.	fear
Let us not look back in anger or forward in fear, but around in awareness.	fear
Hope is the only thing stronger than fear.	fear
Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.	fear
The only known antidote to fear is faith.	fear
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear.	fear
There is no hope unmingled with fear, and no fear unmingled with hope.	fear
When we free ourselves from indulging the passions of fear and hope, we increase our power in each moment as we improve our character.	fear
Hope is generally regarded as good. Fear is generally regarded as bad. To a Stoic like Hecato, they are the same � both are projections into the future about things we do not control. Both are the enemy of this present moment that you are actually in. 	fear
It�s not about overcoming our fears but understanding that both hope and fear contain a dangerous amount of want and worry in them. And, sadly, the want is what causes the worry.	fear
In all things it�s better to hope than to despair.	fear
We promise according to our hopes and perform according to our fears.	fear
Fear is the most subtle and destructive of all human diseases. Fear kills dreams and hope.	fear
Fear is the fastest growing industry of our age. The media, Internet, and politics all grow through fear. Out best hopes is the trust and faith we place in our leaders and mentors.	fear
Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it. Let me not look for allies in life�s battlefield but to my own strength. Let me not crave in anxious fear to be saved but hope for the patience to win my freedom.	fear
While your life is the true expression of your faith, whom can you fear?	fear
Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.	fear
As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you.	fear
Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.	fear
When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.	fear
The lord is with me; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?	fear
Even though I walk through the darkest valley,I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.	fear
There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.	fear
Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.	fear
For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.	fear
Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the lord your God will be with you wherever you go.	fear
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.	fear
Jesus told him, �Don�t be afraid; just believe�.	fear
An anxious heart weighs a man down, but a kind word cheers him up.	fear
Meet your fears with faith.	fear
Fear of things invisible is the natural seed of that which everyone in himself calleth religion.	fear
All religion, my friend, is simply evolved out of fraud, fear, greed, imagination, and poetry.	fear
In the darkest of nights cling to the assurance that God loves you, that He always has advice for you, a path that you can tread and a solution to your problem�and you will experience that which you believe. God never disappoints anyone who places his trust in Him.	fear
Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second�s encounter with God and with eternity.	fear
There will always be someone willing to hurt you, put you down, gossip about you, belittle your accomplishments and judge your soul. It is a fact that we all must face. However, if you realize that God is a best friend that stands beside you when others cast stones you will never be afraid, never feel worthless and never feel alone.	fear
The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature.	fear
Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear.	fear
I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone.	fear
The presence of hope in the invincible sovereignty of God drives out fear.	fear
You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.	fear
Fear and suspicion won�t help us live together. We have to cultivate warm-heartedness.	fear
The first reaction to truth is hatred.	fear
Hatred is blind, as well as love.	fear
The jealous are troublesome to others, but a torment to themselves.	fear
A man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of any kind is really a free, a peaceful man.	fear
Once your mind is calm and full of love, there is no room for hatred or fear. Others will trust you because of your open heart.	fear
While many people consider sensory experience as the main source of happiness, really it is peace of mind. What destroys peace of mind is anger, hatred, anxiety and fear. Kindness counters this � and through appropriate education we can learn to tackle such emotions.	fear
Anger and hatred lead to fear; compassion and concern for others allow us to develop self-confidence, which breeds trust and friendship.	fear
It is fear that is the great cause of misery in the world. It is fear that is the greatest of all superstitions. It is the fear that is the cause of our woes, and it is fearlessness that brings heaven in a moment.	fear
Jealousy is the fear of comparison.	fear
Feelings like disappointment, embarrassment, irritation, resentment, anger, jealousy, and fear, instead of being bad news, are actually very clear moments that teach us where it is that we�re holding back. They teach us to perk up and lean in when we feel we�d rather collapse and back away. They�re like messengers that show us, with terrifying clarity, exactly where we�re stuck. This very moment is the perfect teacher, and, lucky for us, it�s with us wherever we are.	fear
Our real enemy is not man; it�s not another human being. Our real enemy is our ignorance, discrimination, fear, craving, and violence.	fear
Hate is a disease. It is fear�s messenger and it makes us do terrible things in a shadow of our better selves, of what we could be.	fear
Fear of something is at the root of hate for others, and hate within will eventually destroy the hater.	fear
Hate is not the first enemy of love. Fear is. It destroys your ability to trust.	fear
If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn�t part of ourselves doesn�t disturb us.	fear
Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius.	fear
To be furious, is to be frighted out of fear.	fear
Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love.	fear
When you are grateful, fear disappears and abundance appears.	fear
We are afraid to care too much, for fear that the other person does not care at all.	fear
Gratitude looks to the Past and love to the Present; fear, avarice, lust, and ambition look ahead.	fear
I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear.	fear
Fear and suspicion won�t help us live together. We have to cultivate warm-heartedness.	fear
On a mental level kindness and compassion give rise to lasting joy. They reduce fear.	fear
There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life.	fear
Gratitude eliminates fear, worry, grief, and depression, and brings happiness, kindness, compassion, understanding, and peace of mind.	fear
It�s easy to take off your clothes and have sex. People do it all the time. But opening up your soul to someone, letting then into your spirit, thoughts, fears, future, hopes, dreams� that is being naked.	fear
Our interactions with one another reflect a dance between love and fear.	fear
Watch how your mind judges. Judgment comes, in part, out of your own fear. You judge other people because you�re not comfortable in your own being. By judging, you find out where you stand in relation to other people.	fear
Many of us have fear. Fear of loving too much, and the fear and the pain of loving when you know there will be loss � and then when there is loss, there is of course deep grief.	fear

If fear is the great enemy of intimacy, love is its true friend.	fear
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.	fear

Fear is the first of our enemies.	fear
The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration.	loneliness
You evolved to hunt and fight and create and connect. Not sit at home and watch TV and cram pizza into your intestines all the damn time. No wonder you feel sad, lonely, and depressed – in fact, it would be surprising if you didn’t.	loneliness

Don’t live in a manner that makes you despise being alone with yourself.	loneliness

If a man cannot understand the beauty of life, it is probably because life never understood the beauty in him.	loneliness

In the long run, every pain is a gift.	loneliness
It is the barren silence of winter that makes the birdsong and blossoms of spring so enchanting. Leisure after labor. Company after solitude. Home after a voyage. Contrasts reveal the nature of things. The world is always in flux. Appreciate the season while it lasts.	loneliness
Part 1. The wisdom of our language has grasped these two sides of a man’s being alone. It has created the word loneliness in order to emphasize the pain of being alone, and it has created the word solitude in order to emphasize the glory of being alone. In daily life, these words are not always distinguished; but we should do it consistently, thus deepening by these very words the understanding of our human predicament.	loneliness
Part 2. Loneliness can be conquered alone by those who can bear solitude. Let us dare to have solitude — to face the eternal, to find others, to see ourselves.	loneliness
Alternate between the solitary and the social. Whether alone or with others, keep serenity.	loneliness
The best way to get approval is not to need it.	loneliness
Part 1. Modern society gives us incredible flexibility in that we can get away from our crazy family members, and we’re not destined to die where we were born or do what our parents did. So we have incredible freedom.	loneliness
Part 2. But then coming with it is this tremendous loneliness that we try and cover up either through drugs or alcohol, or partying, even trying to find a mission like putting people on Mars. But the reality is a lot of that loneliness just comes from being disconnected from growing up with your tribal environment.	loneliness
The only way to survive is to admit you are on your own, learn to make your own decisions, and trust your judgement.	loneliness
When you’re alone, watch your thoughts. When you’re successful, watch your ego. When you’ve got problems, watch your emotions. When you’re with the crowds, watch what you say.	loneliness
You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.	loneliness
What is needed is this, and this alone: solitude, great inner loneliness. Going into oneself and not meeting anyone for hours – that is what one must arrive at.	loneliness
It is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be a reason the more for us to do it.	loneliness
Sometimes life is too hard to be alone, and sometimes life is too good to be alone.	loneliness
Loneliness is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every man.	loneliness
Seeking truth is a lonely business.	loneliness
Religion, science, and spirituality help us make sense of the world. Life without at least one of them is a lonely and confusing place.	loneliness

A life without pain and suffering is like a sea without waves: lifeless. Be rational, take a new perspective and detach yourself, they will pass.	loneliness
If you are a thoughtful person you are alone in this world. Do not expect anyone to understand you or to share your perspective.	loneliness
When you let go of the need for respectability and no longer care about your social image, you unchain yourself from the bonds of mediocrity. If you care about what others think you are not free to be yourself. You live a fake life which no amount of outward success can justify.	loneliness
Chasing after your dreams is lonely. No one will understand your struggles. Such sacrifices are silent and without rewards. You must be content within your own being.	loneliness
Living alone, though it may not be the state you ultimately desire for yourself, affords an unparalleled opportunity to know yourself, to be yourself, and to develop yourself as a unique and interesting individual.	loneliness
A young outcast will often feel that there is something wrong with himself, but as he gets older, grows more confident in who he is, he will adapt, he will begin to feel that there is something wrong with everyone else.	loneliness
Quiet people always know more than they seem. Although very normal, their inner world is by default fronted mysterious and therefore assumed weird.

For in the end, freedom is a personal and lonely battle; and one faces down fears of today so that those of tomorrow might be engaged.	loneliness
Solitude is strength; to depend on the presence of the crowd is weakness. The man who needs a mob to nerve him is much more alone than he imagines.	loneliness
The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.	loneliness
I was very often full of rage and despair. I was always lonely. In spite of all that I was and am in love with life.	loneliness

Put down the phone, turn off the laptop, and do something—anything—that does not involve a screen.	loneliness

He craved silences and solitude. He simply could not get lost in another person’s life.	loneliness
What a commentary on civilization, when being alone is being suspect; when one has to apologize for it, make excuses, hide the fact that one practices it — like a secret vice.	loneliness
We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and — in spite of true romance magazines — we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely — at least, not all the time — but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don’t see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness.	loneliness
Your relationship with yourself is a marriage from which there is no earthly escape. Death is the only divorce. A well-ordered mind is at home with solitude. A contented man can tolerate his own company.	loneliness

I never feel unsafe except for when the majority is on my side.	loneliness
Yes, be different, but not for the vanities of being different.	loneliness
He felt that if he could not be alone, and if he could not be left alone, he would die.	loneliness
It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few.	loneliness
You are free if you can withdraw from people, not having to seek them out for the sake of money, company, love, glory or curiosity, none of which can thrive in silence and solitude.	loneliness

For it is in your power to retire into yourself whenever you choose.	loneliness

The more alone you are, the less contaminated you will be by society, the more original and powerful your work will be.	loneliness
Clear and independent thinkers are far rarer than “smart” or “educated”.	loneliness
In order to be open to creativity, one must have the capacity for constructive use of solitude. One must overcome the fear of being alone.	loneliness
Deep understanding requires deep thinking which requires focused time alone, away from the chatter of people online and offline. It requires staying with a single thought for a long time, focusing on it and developing it. In solitude is the genesis of great ideas.	loneliness
Most original and fruitful ideas come to us when thinking for ourselves, without any outside incentive or pressure to show off our intellectual brilliance.	loneliness
No great creative work can ever be done without the help of solitude. There is a reason why the greatest creators of all time, and the profoundest of thinkers have all been introverts.	loneliness
You have to find your own shtick. A Picasso always looks like Picasso painted it. Hemingway always sounds like Hemingway. A Beethoven symphony always sounds like a Beethoven symphony. Part of being a master is learning how to sing in nobody else’s voice but your own.	loneliness
When we let our focus shift away from the people and things around us, we are better able to engage in what’s called meta-cognition, or the process of thinking critically and reflectively about our own thoughts.	loneliness
Keep working on yourself. The difference between those who wasted time and those who used it well becomes more and more obvious as the years go by. Work in silence and in a few years you’ll be so far ahead that they’ll think you cheated. 'What was your name?'	loneliness
Writing is a solitary occupation. Family, friends, and society are the natural enemies of the writer. He must be alone, uninterrupted, and slightly savage if he is to sustain and complete an undertaking.	loneliness
One reason I stay isolated more than the average person is to keep my creativity as fierce as possible. Being the odd one out may have its temporary disadvantages, but more importantly, it has its permanent advantages.	loneliness
If it’s true what is said, that only the wise discover the wise, then it must also be true that the lone wolf symbolizes either the biggest fool on the planet or the biggest Einstein on the planet.	loneliness
What is a genius? A person who demands little to nothing from others, but is often found extremely difficult to have around.	loneliness

If you can’t see what you’re worthy, you are more likely to be with someone else who can’t see it.	loneliness
It’s not your job to like me – it’s mine.	loneliness
I am a lover without a lover. I am lovely and lonely and I belong deeply to myself.	loneliness
One of the greatest regrets in life is being what others would want you to be, rather than being yourself.	loneliness
The feelings we live through in love and in loneliness are simply, for us, what high tide and low tide are to the sea.	loneliness
And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.	loneliness
Love consists of this: two solitudes that meet, protect and greet each other.	loneliness
To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.	loneliness
Eventually people stop reaching out. Slowly at first. Then all at once.	loneliness
Strive to be emotionally self-sufficient so you can draw closer to other people.	loneliness
It is in deep solitude that I find the gentleness with which I can truly love my brothers. The more solitary I am the more affection I have for them. Solitude and silence teach me to love my brothers for what they are, not for what they say.	loneliness
Companionship is a foreign concept to some people. They fear it as much as the majority of people fear loneliness.	loneliness
It’s pretty simple: the less face to face I have with a person, the more I feel disconnected.	loneliness
I’m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.	loneliness
Enduring loneliness is almost invariably better than suffering the compromises of false community.	loneliness
There are many friends that I lost touch with because I outgrew them. I grew, my tastes, desires, and interests changed. They stayed the same. Eventually, I had nothing in common with them anymore. The fast path is a long, hard, and lonely one. But every step is worth it.	loneliness
One lesson from the success of podcasts and YouTube: there is an enormous market for digital companionship. We are profoundly social creatures. Modern life can be lonely. We miss the chatter of the ancestral campfire. We import voices to fill the silence and feel less isolated.	loneliness
Independence? That’s middle class blasphemy. We are all dependent on one another, every soul of us on earth.	loneliness
You can’t depend on anyone else to be happy; no relationship will give you the inner peace that you haven’t created.	loneliness
To find peace, you have to be willing to lose the connection with the people, places, and things that create all the noise in your life.	loneliness
If you meet a loner, no matter what they tell you, it’s not because they enjoy solitude. It’s because they have tried to blend into the world before, and people continue to disappoint them.	loneliness
This is the duty of our generation as we enter the twenty-first century – solidarity with the weak, the persecuted, the lonely, the sick, and those in despair. It is expressed by the desire to give a noble and humanizing meaning to a community in which all members will define themselves not by their own identity but by that of others.	loneliness
Why do people have to be this lonely? What’s the point of it all? Millions of people in this world, all of them yearning, looking to others to satisfy them, yet isolating themselves. Why? Was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness? 	loneliness
Lonely people tend, rather, to be lonely because they decline to bear the psychic costs of being around other humans. They are allergic to people. People affect them too strongly.	loneliness
The best of community does give one a deep sense of belonging and well-being; and in that sense community takes away loneliness.	loneliness
Losing friends that are easily lost is no loss at all.	loneliness
Pay attention to humans, not to your phone.	loneliness
As we distribute ourselves, we may abandon ourselves.	loneliness
Technology proposes itself as the architect of our intimacies.	loneliness
It’s a highly deceptive world, one that constantly asks you to comment but doesn’t really care what you have to say.	loneliness
Why should I use social media if my human nature is all about envy, jealousy, comparisons and competition?	loneliness
There’s not a single exception. All screen activities are linked to less happiness, and all nonscreen activities are linked to more happiness.	loneliness
If you are on social media, and you are not learning, not laughing, not being inspired or not networking, then you are using it wrong.	loneliness
What is it that is so interesting about what’s happening everywhere else but where you are?	loneliness
Unmoderated content consumption is as dangerous as the consumption of sewage water.	loneliness
Our social tools are not an improvement to modern society, they are a challenge to it.	loneliness
Social media is to socializing what masturbating is to sex.	loneliness
Just as junk food makes you feel both bloated and empty afterward, social snacking only leaves you with much time wasted and more loneliness than before.	loneliness
It is ironic, but perhaps not surprising, that reducing social media, which promised to help us connect with others, actually helps people feel less lonely and depressed.	loneliness
Technology is seductive when what it offers meets our human vulnerabilities. And as it turns out, we are very vulnerable indeed.	loneliness
We are lonely but fearful of intimacy. Digital connections and the sociable robot may offer the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship.	loneliness
Our networked life allows us to hide from each other, even as we are tethered to each other. We’d rather text than talk.	loneliness
We fill our days with ongoing connection, denying ourselves time to think and dream.	loneliness
Even the technology that promises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now electronically connected to the globe, and yet we feel utterly alone.	loneliness
We live in nuclear family units, often living large distances away from our extended family and friends, and our growing reliance on social technology rather than face to face interaction is thought to be making us feel more isolated. 	loneliness
There was nothing lonelier than a man with a million friends.	loneliness
It’s okay to be alone, to be sad, to rest and repair. Really.	loneliness
Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves.	loneliness
You don’t know who is important to you until you actually lose them.	loneliness
Loneliness is emptiness begging to be filled.	loneliness
Sadness is fine. Feeling lonely is fine. Boredom is fine, too. Don’t try to escape them. Once they are fully lived, move on to the next thing.	loneliness
You got to go down a lot of wrong roads to find the right one.	loneliness
I’m lonely. And I’m lonely in some horribly deep way and for a flash of an instant, I can see just how lonely, and how deep this feeling runs. And it scares the shit out of me to be this lonely because it seems catastrophic.	loneliness
Frustration stems from focusing on what we don’t have. The antidote is appreciating what’s already here.	loneliness
There is also kind of just the abject loneliness that all of us can feel that comes from being disconnected from our roots, and our roots are very tribal.	loneliness
Life is very interesting. Boredom is a failure of imagination.	loneliness
Boredom is the root of all evil – the despairing refusal to be oneself.	loneliness
When people are bored, it is primarily with their own selves that they are bored.	loneliness
Boredom comes from a boring mind.	loneliness
The worst you can do when you feel lonely is to hope and wait. When you lose sight of the shore, hoping and waiting will get you nowhere, moving forward will.	loneliness
My loneliness was born when men praised my talkative faults and blamed my silent virtues.	loneliness
Sometimes the worst place to be is in your head.	loneliness
Youth always tries to fill the void, an old man learns to live with it.	loneliness
It’s solitary drinking that makes drunkards.	loneliness
My peers, lately, have found companionship through means of intoxication – it makes them sociable. I, however, cannot force myself to use drugs to cheat on my loneliness – it is all that I have – and when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, will be all that my peers have as well.	loneliness
Remember: the time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself. Life’s cruelest irony.	loneliness
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, but it sure makes the rest of you lonely.	loneliness
Loneliness is the human condition. No one is ever going to fill that space. The best you can do is know yourself; know what you want.	loneliness
The hardest walk is walking alone, but it’s also the walk that makes you the strongest.	loneliness
I got lost but look what I found.	loneliness
Is life not a thousand times too short for us to bore ourselves?	loneliness
When all else is lost, the future still remains.	loneliness
The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, peculiar to myself and to a few other solitary men, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence. When we examine the moments, acts, and statements of all kinds of people — not only the grief and ecstasy of the greatest poets, but also the huge unhappiness of the average soul…we find, I think, that they are all suffering from the same thing. The final cause of their complaint is loneliness.	loneliness
Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.	loneliness
We feel alone, and in this we are connected.	loneliness
Every single human being who is alive has felt this kind of pain, hopelessness, and loneliness at one time or another. We are all connected through this shared pain and struggle.	loneliness
Our great depression is our lives. We�ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we�d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won�t. We�re slowly learning that fact. And we�re very, very pissed off.	loneliness
There is nothing outside of yourself, look within. Everything you want is there � you are That.	loneliness
The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It�s the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.	loneliness
If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never truly be fulfilled. Lao Tzu	loneliness
Remember never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; nay, God is within, and your genius is within.	loneliness
Rise to the level of your ideals, not the average of your environment.	loneliness
Lonely is not being alone, it�s the feeling that no one cares.	loneliness
You cannot be lonely if you like the person you�re alone with.	loneliness
Loneliness is the poverty of self; solitude is the richness of self.	loneliness
What a lovely surprise to discover how unlonely being alone can be.	loneliness
If you are afraid of being lonely, don�t try to be right.	loneliness
As soon as I realized happiness was internal and that I was the only one responsible for it, I stopped feeling lonely.	loneliness
I don�t mind being alone. I just don�t want to be part of the crowd.	loneliness
The reality is life is a single-player game. You�re born alone. You�re going to die alone. All of your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone. You�re gone in three generations and nobody cares. Before you showed up, nobody cared. It�s all single-player.	loneliness
We feel guilt when we no longer want to associate with old friends and colleagues who haven�t changed. The price, and marker, of growth.	loneliness
We�re used to constantly judging things. The act of judging something separates you from that thing.	loneliness
Over time, as you judge, judge, judge, you invariably judge people. You judge yourself. You separate yourself from everything, and then you end up lonely.	loneliness
That feeling of disconnection, loneliness, is eventually what leads to suffering.	loneliness
Be strong enough to stand alone, smart enough to know when you need help, and brave enough to ask for it.	loneliness
He who�s mind is not steady does not find happiness either amongst the people or in the solitude of the forest. When alone, he longs for company, and when in company, he longs for solitude.	loneliness
If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.	loneliness
We don�t need sugar, flour or rice or anything else. We just want to see our dear ones.	loneliness
Inside myself is a place where I live all alone, and that�s where I renew my springs that never dry up.	loneliness
A lonely day is God�s way of saying that he wants to spend some quality time with you.	loneliness
The crowds poison, too much time and you end up like them. Retreat to yourself. The only safe place.	loneliness
All of humanity�s problems stem from man�s inability to sit quietly in a room alone. 	loneliness
It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely.	loneliness
No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.	loneliness
I want to be with those who know secret things or else alone.	loneliness
I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It�s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you feel alone.	loneliness
Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty.	loneliness
Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.	loneliness
Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.	loneliness
What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.	loneliness
Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.	loneliness
The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud.	loneliness
A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke.	loneliness
Sometimes it is necessary to be lonely in order to prove that you are right.	loneliness
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.	loneliness
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.	loneliness
I came alone in this world, I have walked alone in the valley of the shadow of death, and I shall quit alone when the time comes.	loneliness
I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.	loneliness
Love and compassion open our own inner life, reducing stress, distrust and loneliness.	loneliness
I restore myself when I�m alone.	loneliness
I don�t want to be alone. I want to be left alone.	loneliness
The worst loneliness is to not be comfortable with yourself.	loneliness
Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform (or pause and reflect).	loneliness
Only the self-sufficient stand alone � most people follow the crowd and imitate.	loneliness
I am here for you.	loneliness
You are not alone. Trust me.	loneliness
I�m a lion in a strange land.	loneliness
Where�s your will to be weird?	loneliness
I�m strong because I was lonely.	loneliness
This task is yours and yours alone.	loneliness
Solitude vivifies; isolation kills.	loneliness
I might be alone, but I�m never lonely.	loneliness
Loneliness is one thing, solitude another.	loneliness
A man thinking or working is always alone.	loneliness
Large groups are no place for smart people.	loneliness
Where will you find the virtuous man? Alone.	loneliness
I like to be alone, but I hate being lonely.	loneliness
What loneliness is more lonely than distrust?	loneliness
If one�s different, one�s bound to be lonely.	loneliness
If you can�t live alone, you were born a slave.	loneliness
If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.	loneliness
Chance never helps those who do not help themselves.	loneliness
Don�t feel lonely, the entire universe is inside you.	loneliness

All great and precious things are lonely.	loneliness
I wish I could show you when you are lonely or in darkness the astonishing light of your own being.	loneliness
I owe everything that I have done to the fact that I am very much at ease being alone.	loneliness
Know that even if you feel alone, you are not alone. I, for one, am connected to you because I�m thinking of you, all of you. I�m connected to you because I too have suffered in similar ways. We have shared pain, shared hopelessness, shared loneliness. Leo Babauta	loneliness
I can�t take away your pain, but I can offer you two miracles: the love that comes from turning toward other human beings, and the connection we have to everyone on Earth.	loneliness
The loneliness you feel is actually an opportunity to reconnect with others and yourself.	loneliness
What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world�s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great person is one who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.	loneliness
Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.	loneliness
Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another. Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.	loneliness
If you go deeper and deeper into your own heart, you�ll be living in a world with less fear, isolation and loneliness.	loneliness
The ultimate power in life is to be completely self-reliant, completely yourself.	loneliness
I prefer winter and fall, when you feel the bone structure of the landscape � the loneliness of it, the dead feeling of winter. Something waits beneath it, the whole story doesn�t show.	loneliness
I am completely a loner. In my head I want to feel I can be anywhere. There is a sort of recklessness that being a loner allows me.	loneliness
It�s ok to feel lonely sometimes. We are human and to feel is to live. Loneliness is a feeling just like any other; happiness, joy etc. If we don�t feel lonely sometimes, how would we feel when we are happy and joyous? The Happy Philosopher	loneliness
It is not easy to be a person of high standards; you have to pay for it. It does, however, make you stand out from the crowd, which alone makes it worth more than its price.	loneliness
If you want to be in the top 1% of a particular domain, then you can�t take your cues from and follow the social norms of 99% of people. This is harder than it sounds. We are wired to imitate. The further you want to climb, the more carefully you need to construct your tribe. James Clear	loneliness
Work in silence. It is the silent work the work done in solitude done purely in principle and conviction driven by a force of purpose that separates men.	loneliness
I am thankful to all those who said no. It�s because of them, I did it myself.	loneliness
Nothing can dim the light that shines from within.	loneliness

Either give me more wine or leave me alone.	loneliness
I�m sick of not having the courage to be an absolute nobody.	loneliness
There is a guy in the coffee shop sitting alone and drinking coffee like a crazy person. No phone. No laptop. No smart watch. No book. Just coffee. Alone with his thoughts.	loneliness
To be successful, one has to be one of three bees � the queen bee, the hardest working bee, or the bee that does not fit in.	loneliness
Yes, I guess you could say I am a loner, but I feel more lonely in a crowded room with boring people that I feel on my own.	loneliness
Solitude is fine but you need someone to tell that solitude is fine.	loneliness
The irony of loneliness is we all feel it at the same time � together.	loneliness
So you�re a little weird? Work it! A little different? Own it! Better to be a nerd than one of the herd!	loneliness
Laugh and the world laughs with you, snore and you sleep alone.	loneliness
Sometimes a scream is better than a thesis.	loneliness
Solitude can be tolerated only up to a certain limit, you know.	loneliness
Sometimes a scream is better than a thesis.	loneliness
Solitude can be tolerated only up to a certain limit, you know.	loneliness
I am a real lone wolf who has never wholeheartedly belonged to the State, to my country, my circle of friends and not even to my family but who, despite all these bonds, has constantly experienced a feeling of strangeness and the need for solitude.	loneliness
I�m so scared of dying without ever being really seen. Can you understand?	loneliness
We�re all lonely for something we don�t know we�re lonely for. How else to explain the curious feeling that goes around feeling like missing somebody we�ve never even met?	loneliness
After 10 years of depression and loneliness, I realized the person I missed the most was not another, but myself.	loneliness
Human beings can�t bear silence. It would mean that they would bear themselves.	loneliness
We�re all islands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding.	loneliness
No one has ever properly understood me, I have never fully understood anyone; and no one understands anyone else.	loneliness
It is not up to others to protect or help you. You are on your own.	loneliness
No one is really going to help you or give you direction.	loneliness
We must all die alone, which really means, that our pain is for us alone to endure. Others can throw us words of encouragement, but in every life, we are out on the ocean drowning in the swell and others, even the nice ones, are standing on the shore, waving cheerily.	loneliness
Loneliness is the longing for connection.	loneliness
To feel lonely is to join the rest of humanity in acknowledging the painful reality that we are somehow fundamentally separated from each other, never to be fully understood.	loneliness
The modern struggle � Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising, up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games and addictive drugs.	loneliness
Reality is neutral. Our reactions reflect back and create our world. Judge, and feel separate and lonely. Anger, and lose peace of mind. Cling, and live in anxiety. Fantasize, and miss the present. Desire, and suffer until you have it. Heaven and hell are right here, right now.	loneliness
It is better for an exceptional individual to be alone (and in the company of great men of the past and present through their books, etc) than to be in the mediocrizing influence of those around him. A genius is nourished by his solitary rebellion against the ways of society.	loneliness
Every man alone is sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins.	loneliness
The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration.	loneliness
You evolved to hunt and fight and create and connect. Not sit at home and watch TV and cram pizza into your intestines all the damn time. No wonder you feel sad, lonely, and depressed � in fact, it would be surprising if you didn�t.	loneliness
Most people keep eating not because they�re hungry, but because they�re bored.	loneliness
A man is born alone and dies alone, and he experiences the good and bad consequences of his karma alone, and he goes alone to hell or the Supreme abode.	loneliness
If you want to live a miserable life, then blame everyone for your problems and never take responsibility for anything.	loneliness
Don�t live in a manner that makes you despise being alone with yourself.	loneliness
People fear the places the undistracted mind might wander too. Much of what people describe as boredom is in fact a fear of stillness. Distraction lets us fill our minds with other voices so we don�t have to listen to the inner voice that whispers truths we fear to confront.	loneliness
If a man cannot understand the beauty of life, it is probably because life never understood the beauty in him.	loneliness
Isn�t it funny that at Christmas something in you gets so lonely for � I don�t know what exactly, but it�s something that you don�t mind so much not having at other times.	loneliness
The loneliest moment in someone�s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.	loneliness
Being alone never felt right. Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right.	loneliness
The price for independence is often isolation and solitude.	loneliness
To find yourself, think for yourself.	loneliness
I am a real lone wolf who has never wholeheartedly belonged to the State, to my country, my circle of friends and not even to my family but who, despite all these bonds, has constantly experienced a feeling of strangeness and the need for solitude.	loneliness

When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always hope.	hope
That was all a man needed: hope. It was lack of hope that discouraged a man.	hope
We dream to give ourselves hope. To stop dreaming – well, that’s like saying you can never change your fate.	hope
Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there’s no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic.	hope
I have learned two lessons in my life: first, there are no sufficient literary, psychological, or historical answers to human tragedy, only moral ones. Second, just as despair can come to one another only from other human beings, hope, too, can be given to one only by other human beings.	hope
The value of another’s experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed.	hope
Strange as it may seem, I still hope for the best, even though the best, like an interesting piece of mail, so rarely arrives, and even when it does it can be lost so easily.	hope
Even in the mud and scum of things, something always, always sings.	hope
Never talk defeat. Use words like hope, belief, faith, victory.	hope
It’s the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee.	hope
Audacity augments courage; hesitation, fear.	hope
The first quality that is needed is audacity.	hope
Where there is no hope, it is incumbent on us to invent it.	hope
Faith has to do with things that are not seen and hope with things that are not at hand.	hope
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come.	hope
Hope is sweet-minded and sweet-eyed. It draws pictures; it weaves fancies; it fills the future with delight.	hope
As long as there is one upright man, as long as there is one compassionate woman, the contagion may spread and the scene is not desolate. Hope is the thing that is left to us, in a bad time.	hope
There is nothing more majestic than the determined courage of individuals willing to suffer and sacrifice for their freedom and dignity.	hope
If you have made mistakes, there is always another chance for you. You may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing we call “failure” is not the falling down, but the staying down.	hope
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.	hope
Optimism is an expectation of the future, but hope is a way of experiencing the present. Optimism argues with the predictions of cynicism and bitterness, and is often proved wrong. Hope rejects cynicism and bitterness as unhelpful, and is perennially proved right.	hope
The greatest personalities that ever existed have been those who united human beings and put them on the road toward cooperation and effectiveness and peace. Those whom the world has held highest have helped to unite and not sever interconnectedness. They have not been the destroyers of differences but the harmonizer of differences.	hope
Hope is a force of nature. Don’t let anyone tell you different.	hope
Plant seeds of happiness, hope, success, and love; it will all come back to you in abundance. This is the law of nature.	hope
The inability to open up to hope is what blocks trust, and blocked trust is the reason for blighted dreams.	hope
None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have Faith.	hope
What would happen if we were all brave enough to be a little bit more ambitious? I think the world would change.	hope
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.	hope
Where hope would otherwise become hopelessness, it becomes faith.	hope
Each time a person stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, these ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.	hope
It’s important to emphasize that hope is only a beginning; it’s not a substitute for action, only a basis for it.	hope
None who have always been free can understand the terrible fascinating power of the hope of freedom to those who are not free.	hope
We yearned for the future. How did we learn it, that talent for insatiability?	hope
Fear created gods; audacity created kings.	hope
The past is made out of facts… I guess the future is just hope.	hope
Hope – hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.	hope
Hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire;	hope
what led the greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation;	hope
what led young women and young men to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through Selma and Montgomery for freedom’s cause.	hope
Hope is what led me here today – with a father from Kenya, a mother from Kansas;	hope
and a story that could only happen in the United States of America.	hope
Hope is the bedrock of this nation; the belief that our destiny will not be written for us, but by us;	hope
by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is;	hope
who have courage to remake the world as it should be.	hope
To be hopeful in bad times is based on the fact that human history is not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.	hope

Verities and realities of your existence.	hope

And to-morrow is only a vision;	hope
But to-day well lived makes	hope
Every yesterday a dream of happiness,	hope
And every tomorrow a vision of hope.	hope
Look well therefore to this day!	hope
Such is the salutation of the dawn!	hope

I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.	hope
